20210705_RTLC_S2_RSG_300.ncf --> P1 exported

Manually added a FSC-H 300 threshold to match other datasets and added P1 gate to match where we know that SYBR cutoffs show cells
No SYBR in this dataset but the data looks similar enough to the other two that the SYBR gating from the others fit even without the SYBR data.
