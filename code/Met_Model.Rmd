## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
#create a markov chain: set p as prob to take a step and 1-p=q as prob to stay put
p=.7
q=1-p
m<-matrix(c(q,p,0,0,0,0,q,p,0,0,0,0,q,p,0,0,0,0,q,p,0,0,0,0,1),5,5,byrow = T)
m

cumsum(m[,])

?tail

tail(c(1,3,4,3),1)

#take a step
stepper<-function(h){
cur<-tail(h,1)
z<-runif(1)
new<-min(which(z<=cumsum(m[cur,])))
return(new)
}

#build a path of steps
path<-function(p){
last=1
i<-0
while(last<5 & i<10000){
p<-c(p,stepper(p))
last=tail(p,1)
i=i+1
}
return(p)
}

#test it
path(1)

test <- fitdist(len, "gamma")
test2 <- fitdist(len, "lnorm")

#do it a million times
ans<-list()
for(j in 1:100000)ans[[j]]<-path(1)
len<-sapply(ans,length) #subtract for to bring the smallest path possible from 5 to 1
hist(len,freq=F, xlim=c(0.5,19.5), breaks = c(seq(0.5,19.5,1)))
mean(log(len))
sd(log(len))
#curve(dlnorm(x,mean(log(len)),sd(log(len))),from=0,to=20,add=T)
curve(dgamma(x, shape = test$estimate[1], rate = test$estimate[2]), from =0, to = 20, add = T, col = "blue")
curve(dlnorm(x, meanlog = test2$estimate[1], sdlog = test2$estimate[2]), from = 0, to = 20, add = T, col = "green")
curve((factorial(x-2)/(factorial(s-2)*factorial((x-2)-(s-2))))*(p^(s-1))*(q^(x-s)), from=3, to =20, add = T, col = "red")
curve((((8*p)^(x))*(exp(-(8*p))))/(factorial(x)), from = 0, to = 20, add = T, col = "black")

1000000*p
x <- seq(from = 0, to = 10, by = 1)
y <- ((4*p)^x)*(exp(-(4*p)))/(factorial(x))

plot(y ~ x)

#create new distribution summing each group of n lengths
n=5
foo<-rep((1:(1000000/5)),each=n)
gamma_maybe<-tapply(len,foo,sum)
hist(gamma_maybe)
```

## Including Plots


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
